### **Description**
Ah, Here we go, my first ever but not last normalized database design. I can't say I wasn't fustrated or confused trying to normalize it. I made a lot of mistakes but also learned from them. As my first project, I immensely enjoyed designing the database. Btw I am also learning markdown to write this first README file :)
